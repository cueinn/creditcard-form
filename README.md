# Frontend Mentor - Interactive card details form

## The challenge

That's a challenge from Frontend Mentor where users should be able to:
- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## Somethings I added
- CSS clamp and relative units to handle in between breakpoints
- A adicional breakpoint to keep the cards centralized
- An small interaction when you hover the cards
- An animation to the success icon when you submit the form
